                        IP cameras are security cameras that use a computer network to send video over an IP network instead of using dedicated infrastructure. Also called network cameras, IP cameras are the optimal solution in security systems and work to provide video surveillance that businesses use. With a vast selection on the market, each one is just as different as each business and can be overwhelming.
                        <br>
                        Surveillance camera professionals at CSL Service understand networking infrastructure and the fundamentals of video security systems.
